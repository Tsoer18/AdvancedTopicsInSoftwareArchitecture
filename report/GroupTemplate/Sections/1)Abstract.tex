This paper focuses on the significance of software architecture, with the primary focus on developing software for a tank production system under the principles of Industry 4.0. Despite a lack of literature on tank production and availability, the research aims to fill this gap by concentrating on deployability, interoperability, and availability as key Quality Attributes (QAs). 

The methodology involves a literature review, creating use cases, and implementing tactics/patterns to address QAs. The heartbeat tactic is the element in ensuring continuous system operation, particularly for the QA availability. The paper details the design, implementation and verification processes, including an experiment assessing our system responsiveness. 

The results show the response time of the system, illustrating its ability to detect and notify operators of defects and errors. Despite limited existing literature on tank production and availability, the paper shows the importance of software architecture in addressing this research gap.
