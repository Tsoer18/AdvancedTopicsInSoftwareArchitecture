Overall the product that we produced has a lot of functionality, but the system as a whole cannot be called a finished product. Given more time, an extension or the development of the systems second iteration, there are several key areas to be improved upon, as we had multiple shortcomings during the project, due to time constraints resulting from several factors.

While the setup of the architecture was a success and the microservice architectures allowed us to achieve the quality attributes that we decided upon for the system, there were a couple of services that were left unfinished and therefore the application as a whole is missing some system functionality.
Firstly, the inventory system. Without the inventory system, there is no way of knowing what parts are currently in storage and what might be missing. If an order is made, the system cannot check whether it is actually able to be completed with the current stock inventory or if parts need to be ordered, in order to complete the order. The design and functionality for the inventory system has been made and is awaiting implementation, given more time.
Secondly, the configuration system, which would receive an order for a tank from the scheduler. From here the configuration system would make a set of instructions in the form of a string, and send it back to the scheduler, which would delegate the instruction string to the necessary robots, in order to complete the order and construct the product(tank). Similarly to the inventory system, this design and functionality for the configuration system is completed and is awaiting implementation given a future work period.

Lastly, more thorough testing. Most importantly, testing our use cases to ensure that all system functionality is working as intended. And if not iterate through our shortcomings the ensure the system fulfills the use cases. Afterwards further testing of the other quality attributes would be necessary, to solidify our confidence in the system architecture upholding the requirements for the quality attributes.
